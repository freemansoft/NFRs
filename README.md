# NFRs

Non Functional Requirements are architecturally significant requrements because they impact the system architecture.  Non functional requirements impact the system as a whole and are cross cutting across business features.

# NFR Definitions

This document describes one way of describing NFRs. 
This format is designed to present NFRs _at a glance_
Those requiring more details in their NFRs should choose a different format.

## Various NFR Category Taxonomies
NFRs are often grouped with related NFRs into _Categories_.  There are many different published NFR categories and Category Type aggeregationsrs.  The links below show some Categories that are grouped under described Category Types
